            <h5><span>CRICKETER (Wicket-keeper) | CAPTAIN | LEADER | Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army</span></h5>
              <p>‘Thanks. Thanks a lot for ur love and support throughout. from 1929 hrs consider me as Retired’. And, just like that, Mahendra Singh Dhoni became a former India cricketer.<br>
                With Mahendra Singh Dhoni announcing his international retirement, a Dhoni-sceptic-turned-devotee reflects on the providential career of Indian cricket’s most decorated leader.
                The hallmark of greatness is its tendency to be taken for granted, to make the world believe in its inevitability.
                To convince its audience that no matter the context, the circumstance or the characters, greatness will prevail in its challenges, almost always.
                For more than 15 years, Mahendra Singh Dhoni represented this exact greatness, frequently converting the impossible into the inevitable, calmly throbbing along as the beating heart of a sport that billions of Indians expect to be synonymous with success.</p>
